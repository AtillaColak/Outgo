## INTRO
This is a CLI app for self-development. 
It works through resources and playlists.
You can create your own playlists, and add whatever resource you want (add a new resource of your choosing or use one I've added already). 

## HOW TO RUN IT. 
You have 2 options for this: 
1) If you have Go installed on your computer, you can edit/customize the code however you like and compile the executable yourself (which may be technical).
2) Download and run the appropriate release for your OS from the `releases` list.
# Technicals and Dev Process 
## Web Scraping
* I scraped all the data you see in the resources.json from various trustable websites, blogposts, forums, and GitHub repos.

## What's Missing
* As I targeted to deploy it fast, I did not spend time on modularizing the code, so most of the functionality is bundled in the `main.go`. This is not ideal, but maybe something I'll fix later.
